    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First of all I would explain to my potential 
      client what the web security
      is all about. I would explain why the security in the world wide web is
      so important. Bad planned protection can range a big
      consequences for the company, such as financial risks, losing a client, or
      the worst - losing a reputation and trust which is almost not
      possible to earn back. I would advised that the whole team of
      developers should be aware of the potential risks when It comes to build
      a website. They should have a knowledge about web security and they should
      know how to use it in the practise. Developers have to follow secure
      software. They must have enough practise to be able to eliminate
      different errors in the early stage of coding. This is essential. Next very
      important step is to keep the website update all the time. As long as the
      website, scripts and software is updated it will keep potensional danger
      away. I could also advised using different plugins and security software.
      It is good idea to limit the possiblility of aploading different files
      by the users too. All of this practise increase the security treats. 
      Files are creating a hole in the security system. You should also consider to
      install the SSL certificate. It confirms that your website is safe and
      secure. I can also recommend to use HTTPS encryption. I would advised to
      create a unique passwords as well. The passwords should be very
      complicated and not replicatable and the key have to be outside from the
      website`s directory. I would recommend to have a few copies of the
      project and keep it on different devices. One of the most popular and common
      secure in the website is authoriazation which I can highly recommend. It
      is very difficult for the attackers to break it down. You can simply add an
      authoization protocol or Framework like OneLogin and many others. I can
      also advise to adopt cybersecurity framework. 
      <p>

      There is many ways to protect your website,
      but with the good practise and examples I have mention you should be able to increase the potential attacks.</p>
