    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      First of all I would explain to my potensional client what web security
      mean. I would explain why the security in the world wide web is actually
      so important. The website which has a good protection system gives more
      work for a potensional attacters to deal with. That`s why the webside
      should have a coulpe of fundamential securities program to incrise the
      chances of the potencional attacts. Bad planned protection can range a big
      concequences for the company, such as financial risks, losing a client, or
      what the worst - losing a reputation and trust which is almost not
      possible to earn back. The most popular attact take over the privat
      information of the user such as password, credit card details, account.
      Team of the developers should be aware of the potensional risks when It
      comes to build a website. Actually the whole team working on the same
      project should has a knowlage about serurity system and take the
      responsibility. There is many different serurity programs that you could
      take into the concideration and I will highly recommend the best of them,
      such as:

      <p>
 Cross Side scripting known as XXS</p>
        <p>SQL injection</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity framework</p>
